          The Essentials package is your gateway to structured, results-driven
          fitness with a personalized touch. This tier features a completely
          custom-tailored training program designed specifically for your body,
          goals, and available equipment. Unlike cookie-cutter plans, we assess
          your movement patterns, strength baselines, and recovery capacity to
          create a progressive program that evolves as you do. You'll receive
          monthly program updates, access to our form technique library, and
          bi-monthly check-ins to ensure you're on track. The Essentials tier is
          perfect for self-motivated individuals who need expert programming but
          are comfortable managing their nutrition independently and require
          less frequent coaching interaction.
